# Welcome To My Portfolio!

**Rather than repeating my resume, this page offers additional information and insights for you to get to know more about me.**

## About Me
Hi! I'm Josh, a sophomore studying computer science at Duke University. After looking into many different fields, I've discovered that software engineering is the field I want to pursue. No matter what I do, my goal is the same: to help the world one line of code at a time. 

### Fun Facts
- I enjoy competitive swimming and training mixed martial arts. 
- When I was considering the premed route, I became a licensed EMT. 
- I love learning party tricks such as juggling and solving the Rubik's cube.

## Projects

### [Real Life Among Us](https://github.com/joshualiu555/biosci-assassins/tree/main)

<img width="396" height="843" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-30 at 3 38 03 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e560538-a1d4-4379-bb86-231593c03c6a" />

As mentioned above, I'm part of the Duke Roundtable SLG, which is a social club. We play a popular game called "BioSci Assassins," which is where turn off all the lights in the biological sciences buiding and play a real life version of Among Us. However, the game is played manually, with cards, GroupMe, and a whole lot of shouting. I made this to automate the game and introduce the concept of tasks, similar to the real game. 

### [Competitive Programming Stress Tester](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Stress-Tester/tree/main)

[Docker CLI Version](https://github.com/joshualiu555/stress-tester-docker)

I used to be a competitive programmer, and I often spent ages banging my head against the wall trying to see why my solution was failing on some random, hidden test case. 
I wanted to create a tool that allowed Java users (although I used C++) to stress test their solutions against randomly generated test cases. 

<img width="1272" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 9 08 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0645ec40-9bf1-4713-a7df-dc14c3e1ee26" />

### [Pixel Art Maker](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Pixel-Art-Maker)

![14:31:58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/120903395-8435f280-c60b-11eb-951d-b96d30303164.png)

This was my first project that took around two weeks of constant coding. The purpose was to work on my OOP fundamentals. The inspiration came from a Tech With Tim video where he made a Microsoft Paint clone. 

### [Stupid Superpowers](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Stupid-Superpowers/tree/master)

<img width="448" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-02 at 4 34 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/210282256-a3065f94-c46a-48ec-9bf5-b366c7fdb01c.png">

One day, two of my friends asked me if I wanted to make a spinoff of "Cards Against Humanity." Of course, I agreed, and we made 200 cards while I soloed the webapp. After around 3 months of coding (restarted the entire project from scratch once), we demoed both the physical and digital version. I even wrote my college essay about this, which I firmly believe was a pivotal reason as to why I got into Duke. 

### [Find A Swim](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Find-A-Swim/tree/main)

<img width="324" alt="Screen Shot 2023-12-03 at 7 00 02 PM" src="https://github.com/joshualiu555/Find-A-Swim/assets/53412192/63c10f4e-9e3a-4ae5-933a-534ea4bba7c1">

As a competitive swimmer, I often had trouble finding workouts outside of practice, so I decided to make a database that allows users to create and share workouts. 

### [Strategy Steps](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Strategy-Steps/tree/main)

I used to play a lot of Wii as a kid, and one of my favorite minigames from Wii Party was Strategy Steps. It involves 4 players each picking either 1, 3, or 5. Whoever, gets picks a unique number moves up X amount of steps. The first player to 10 steps wins. I was in a Discord friend group, and I decided to make a little bot that could simulate this game, so we would have something to do while talking. 

### Simulators

**These are all written in Pygame**

**[Maze Generator and Solver](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Maze-Generator-And-Solver)**

[Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/120880638-39779480-c591-11eb-914e-c4ae03ddb413.mov)

This was for a Latin class, where we had to make a project about a Greek myth. I chose Theseus and The Minotaur, which involved a maze / labyrinth, so I created this maze generator and solver. I had also recently gotten into competitive programming, so I wanted to use the DFS algorithm. 

**[Chaos Game](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Chaos-Game)**

https://github.com/joshualiu555/Chaos-Game/assets/53412192/c0c4fd18-c93e-4670-8fb1-7fe8a5c786a3

The Chaos Game is a simulation that creates Sierpinski's triangle, a famous fractal. Here's how it's created: 

1) Draw three dots in the form of a triangle
2) Start at point 1
3) Randomly choose a point 1-3
4) Draw a dot in the middle of those two points
5) This dot is your new point
6) Repeat from step 3 continuosly

**[Game of Life](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Game-Of-Life/tree/main)**

https://github.com/joshualiu555/Game-Of-Life/assets/53412192/9d9ba153-121a-4040-98fe-ec7822718e38

There is a 2D Grid of cells. Each cell checks its 4 neighbors. 

1) Every live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors lives on.
2) Every live cell with 4 neighbors dies due to overpopulation.
3) Every live cell with 1 neighbor dies due to underpopulation.
4) Every dead cell with 3 neighbors is reborn due to reproduction.

### [Valentine's Gift](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Valentine-Gift)

Some of my old friends and I did a Valentine's gift exchange once where we each gave a present to every other person in the group. One of my friends had a running joke that she had crushes on three separate people in the grade in a very short period of time. I copied the code from an old tutorial I followed and changed up the sprites to make her face the main character and the enemies the three crushes. 

### [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Rock-Paper-Scissors/tree/main)

<img width="642" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-02 at 4 17 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/210281457-5bbb6555-aa63-45ee-9a37-23c711f6f989.png">

This was my first ever webdev project. I was on the train to visit an old friend in Philly, and I decided to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. Although it only took a few hours, it was a great intro into the world of webdev.
