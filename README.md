# Welcome To My Portfolio!

**Rather than repeating my resume, this page offers additional information and insights for you to get to know more about me.**

## About Me
Hi! I'm Josh, a rising sophomore studying computer science at Duke University. After looking into many different fields, I've discovered that software engineering is the route I want to go down. I'm interested in everything from the bits and bytes of low level systems to the polish of frontend design. No matter what, my goal is the same: to help the world one line of code at a time. 

### Fun Facts
- I enjoy competitive swimming and training mixed martial arts. 
- When I was considering the premed route, I became a licensed EMT. 
- I love learning party tricks such as juggling and solving the Rubik's cube.

## Projects

### [Real Life Among Us](https://github.com/joshualiu555/biosci-assassins/tree/main)
As mentioned above, I'm part of the Duke Roundtable SLG, which is a social club. We play a popular game called "BioSci Assassins," which is where turn off all the lights in the biological sciences buiding and play a real life version of Among Us. However, the game is played manually, with cards, GroupMe, and a whole lot of shouting. I made this to automate the game and introduce the concept of tasks, similar to the real game. 

### [Competitive Programming Stress Tester](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Stress-Tester/tree/main)
I used to be a competitive programmer, and I often spent ages banging my head against the wall trying to see why my solution was failing on some random, hidden test case. 
I wanted to create a tool that allowed Java users (although I used C++) to stress test their solutions against randomly generated test cases. 

### [Pixel Art Maker](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Pixel-Art-Maker)
This was my first project that took around two weeks of constant coding. The purpose was to work on my OOP fundamentals. The inspiration came from a Tech With Tim video where he made a Microsoft Paint clone.
