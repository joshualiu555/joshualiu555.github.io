# Welcome To My Portfolio!

## About Me
Hi! I'm Josh, a rising sophomore studying computer science at Duke University. After looking into many different fields, I've discovered that software engineering is the route I want to go down. I'm interested in everything from the bits and bytes of low level systems to the polish of frontend design. No matter what, my goal is the same: to help the world one line of code at a time.

### Some fun facts before we get to the nitty gritty
- I was a competitive swimmer for 10 years and have since gotten into mixed martial arts, which is a weird 180. 
- I am a licensed EMT because I considered becoming a doctor. If a medical emergency arises, I'm sure I'll be ready.
- I love learning party tricks such as juggling and solving the Rubik's cube. Right now, I'm learning how to do a kip-up.
