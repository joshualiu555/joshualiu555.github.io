# Welcome To My Portfolio!

**Rather than repeating my resume, this page offers additional information and insights for you to get to know more about me.**

## About Me
Hi! I'm Josh, a rising sophomore studying computer science at Duke University. After looking into many different fields, I've discovered that software engineering is the route I want to go down. I'm interested in everything from the bits and bytes of low level systems to the polish of frontend design. No matter what, my goal is the same: to help the world one line of code at a time. 

### Fun Facts
- I enjoy competitive swimming and training mixed martial arts. 
- When I was considering the premed route, I became a licensed EMT. 
- I love learning party tricks such as juggling and solving the Rubik's cube.

## Experience

### MyGymBuddy
[MyGymBuddy](https://www.mygymbuddy.io) is an app that allows gym goers to find gym buddies to exercise with. We are a small, remote team of 6 based in Indiana, Colorado, and Tennessee. The public beta is launching in Indiana on June 21st, with New York City following soon. 

During my time here, I've participated in weekly SCRUM meetings to discuss progress and plans with the team. I've learned a lot about how a startup functions, how to work with a small team, and most importantly, how tech affects the business side of things. The CEO and CTO are my mentors, but I've also been able to interview others and help get them onboarded. 

### Trio Labs
[Trio Labs](https://triolabs.com) is a company that 3D prints micro parts for multiple different industries. Although the company consists of roughly 50 employees, the software engineering team consists of 6 people as well. 

Since I've worked here, I've progressed from small tickets for the company ERP all the way to writing my own project in Rust. I've listened in on weekly SWE review meetings and receive weekly lectures about a multitude of computer science topics. I've grown very close with the other interns and believe that we'll stay in touch down the line.
