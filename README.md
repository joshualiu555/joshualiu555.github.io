# Welcome To My Portfolio!

**Rather than repeating my resume, this page offers additional information and insights for you to get to know more about me.**

## About Me
Hi! I'm Josh, a sophomore studying computer science at Duke University. After looking into many different fields, I've discovered that software engineering is the route I want to go down. I'm interested in everything from the bits and bytes of low level systems to the polish of frontend design. No matter what, my goal is the same: to help the world one line of code at a time. 

### Fun Facts
- I enjoy competitive swimming and training mixed martial arts. 
- When I was considering the premed route, I became a licensed EMT. 
- I love learning party tricks such as juggling and solving the Rubik's cube.

## Projects

### [Real Life Among Us](https://github.com/joshualiu555/biosci-assassins/tree/main)

<img width="450" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-03 at 11 25 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b624520-e347-4a61-8907-232150643d06" />

As mentioned above, I'm part of the Duke Roundtable SLG, which is a social club. We play a popular game called "BioSci Assassins," which is where turn off all the lights in the biological sciences buiding and play a real life version of Among Us. However, the game is played manually, with cards, GroupMe, and a whole lot of shouting. I made this to automate the game and introduce the concept of tasks, similar to the real game. 

### [Competitive Programming Stress Tester](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Stress-Tester/tree/main)

[Docker CLI Version](https://github.com/joshualiu555/stress-tester-docker)

I used to be a competitive programmer, and I often spent ages banging my head against the wall trying to see why my solution was failing on some random, hidden test case. 
I wanted to create a tool that allowed Java users (although I used C++) to stress test their solutions against randomly generated test cases. 

<img width="1272" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 9 08 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0645ec40-9bf1-4713-a7df-dc14c3e1ee26" />

### [Pixel Art Maker](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Pixel-Art-Maker)

![14:31:58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/120903395-8435f280-c60b-11eb-951d-b96d30303164.png)

This was my first project that took around two weeks of constant coding. The purpose was to work on my OOP fundamentals. The inspiration came from a Tech With Tim video where he made a Microsoft Paint clone. 

### [Stupid Superpowers](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Stupid-Superpowers/tree/master)

<img width="448" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-02 at 4 34 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/210282256-a3065f94-c46a-48ec-9bf5-b366c7fdb01c.png">

One day, two of my friends asked me if I wanted to make a spinoff of "Cards Against Humanity." Of course, I agreed, and we made 200 cards while I soloed the webapp. After around 3 months of coding (restarted the entire project from scratch once), we demoed both the physical and digital version. I even wrote my college essay about this, which I firmly believe was a pivotal reason as to why I got into Duke. 

### [Find A Swim](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Find-A-Swim/tree/main)

<img width="324" alt="Screen Shot 2023-12-03 at 7 00 02 PM" src="https://github.com/joshualiu555/Find-A-Swim/assets/53412192/63c10f4e-9e3a-4ae5-933a-534ea4bba7c1">

As a competitive swimmer, I often had trouble finding workouts outside of practice, so I decided to make a database that allows users to create and share workouts. 

### [Strategy Steps](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Strategy-Steps/tree/main)

I used to play a lot of Wii as a kid, and one of my favorite minigames from Wii Party was Strategy Steps. It involves 4 players each picking either 1, 3, or 5. Whoever, gets picks a unique number moves up X amount of steps. The first player to 10 steps wins. I was in a Discord friend group, and I decided to make a little bot that could simulate this game, so we would have something to do while talking. 

### Simulators

**These are all written in Pygame**

**[Maze Generator and Solver](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Maze-Generator-And-Solver)**

[Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/120880638-39779480-c591-11eb-914e-c4ae03ddb413.mov)

This was for a Latin class, where we had to make a project about a Greek myth. I chose Theseus and The Minotaur, which involved a maze / labyrinth, so I created this maze generator and solver. I had also recently gotten into competitive programming, so I wanted to use the DFS algorithm. 

**[Chaos Game](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Chaos-Game)**

https://github.com/joshualiu555/Chaos-Game/assets/53412192/c0c4fd18-c93e-4670-8fb1-7fe8a5c786a3

The Chaos Game is a simulation that creates Sierpinski's triangle, a famous fractal. Here's how it's created: 

1) Draw three dots in the form of a triangle
2) Start at point 1
3) Randomly choose a point 1-3
4) Draw a dot in the middle of those two points
5) This dot is your new point
6) Repeat from step 3 continuosly

**[Game of Life](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Game-Of-Life/tree/main)**

https://github.com/joshualiu555/Game-Of-Life/assets/53412192/9d9ba153-121a-4040-98fe-ec7822718e38

There is a 2D Grid of cells. Each cell checks its 4 neighbors. 

1) Every live cell with 2 or 3 neighbors lives on.
2) Every live cell with 4 neighbors dies due to overpopulation.
3) Every live cell with 1 neighbor dies due to underpopulation.
4) Every dead cell with 3 neighbors is reborn due to reproduction.

### [Valentine's Gift](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Valentine-Gift)

Some of my old friends and I did a Valentine's gift exchange once where we each gave a present to every other person in the group. One of my friends had a running joke that she had crushes on three separate people in the grade in a very short period of time. I copied the code from an old tutorial I followed and changed up the sprites to make her face the main character and the enemies the three crushes. 

### [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/joshualiu555/Rock-Paper-Scissors/tree/main)

<img width="642" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-02 at 4 17 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53412192/210281457-5bbb6555-aa63-45ee-9a37-23c711f6f989.png">

This was my first ever webdev project. I was on the train to visit an old friend in Philly, and I decided to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. Although it only took a few hours, it was a great intro into the world of webdev.
